PWA Icons Required
==================

The following icon files are missing and need to be created:

1. favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) - Browser tab icon
2. apple-touch-icon.png (180x180) - iOS home screen icon
3. pwa-64x64.png - Small PWA icon
4. pwa-192x192.png - Medium PWA icon (Android)
5. pwa-512x512.png - Large PWA icon (splash screen)

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
For now, placeholder icons have been created to allow the app to run.
Replace these with proper branded icons for production.

DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use company logo or "N" letter mark (for Niğtaş)
- Colors: Blue (#1e40af) for primary, with white background
- Simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
- Square aspect ratio with transparent or solid background
